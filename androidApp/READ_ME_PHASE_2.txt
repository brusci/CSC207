The .java files can be found inside the src folder of the TriageApp folder.
The TriageApp folder is the Android project.
This app is a triage app where in the first page you have a patients button that shows you the list of patients stored in the triage and an add button with a blank where you can input the patient number to add a patient to the triage.
In the triage page you can press on a patient and it will lead you to a record where it displays the patient's properties, vital signs, and symptoms. The first blank is editable so as to add updated properties to the record.
All changes can be reverted by pressing back and not pressing save.
The app reads a patient_records.txt file to get a list of potential patients and reads and writes a patient.txt files to serve as a local record which is the triage. The texts need to be put in /data/data/com.toronto.triageapp/files.
